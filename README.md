## Car Price Prediction

This project predicts the selling price of cars using machine learning regression models. Key steps include data exploration, feature engineering, visualization, model selection (Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor), training, evaluation (using metrics like MSE, RMSE, MAE), cross-validation, and new prediction. It demonstrates the application of regression techniques to predict car prices based on features such as brand, model, year, mileage, and more.
